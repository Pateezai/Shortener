#Shortener
##The URL Shortener
So this is the latest version of The URL Shortener since the first one(github.com/Pateezai/short-url). 
In this version I've used the React library(base for Nextjs in the future) as a frontend(MERN) and using bootstrap for decoration.
This times I've using all of the method(CRUD) due to last times i've been using only CREATE and GET,
So let's begin

So this is the final(not last) UI

In this page is doing it's own work as same as before which are shorten the link with or without custom path and show the resoponse
This Landing Page is similar to the old version but there're more!

So let's see the difference
In this version I've been add the "/fix" path for handle(Update, Delete) the data that have been in put to the db.
This path cannot access through the public link(https://client-proto-shrtner-pateezai.vercel.app/) due to . . . Somthing . . .

So we can click edit to update the path name

http://shortener-api-m65u.onrender.com/wxcxcxc is gone!!

So, In conclusion is this version I've learn the many things from the old one such as React, Method(CRUD) and etc.
There's a lot to be update and fix but it's kinda work right now 

For next version would be involved with User, Registration, JWT, Cookie and etc. 
There's a lot to do and learn, So see you in the Next version
