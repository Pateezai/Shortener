# Shortener
This project is the beginning of URL Shortener website practice start with using MongoDB, Express and Nodejs 

the idea is normally usual url shortener websites are only provided the auto generated path 
which mean if you shorten some url you'll get something(path) like this "www.example.com/ArUfD5" which "ArUfD5" is auto generated path
so I am getting the idea that "How's about we can custom our own path?" that why in our website have a custom box for customize
the path.
